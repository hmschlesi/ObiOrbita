    "## Preparations and setup\n",
    "You need some space to work on the parts and ideally a worksurface that can get used a bit. After all we are working with wood drills, hot glue and boxcutters.\n",
    "The whole build only needs some very basic handtools, but make sure you have all of them at hand, to avoid running into issues during the build process. You will need a battery drill, a drill bit set, a 15 mm faustner drill or similar, allen keys, a box cutter, a wrench with a 13 mm nut, a hot glue gun and some measuring and marking utensils.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Making the base and the bridge\n",
    "The only two parts that that completely need to be build custom for this project are the base board and the bridge that carries the sensors above the turntable. These parts are made out of 12 mm plywood or similar. \n",
    "The stock material could also be some reused wood or some different available board material, as long as the deflection is similar and the dimensions can be cut fairly accurate. We sourced our wood boards from the local hardware store, where they offer a cutting service, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can measure and mark the hole locations for each part by the dimensions given in the two drawings below. Another option is provided through drill templates you can print out and put on your work pieces\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![](gfx/05_bride_dims.JPG)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you marked all the locations you can drill the holes with a fitting drill. The only out of the ordinary holes that need to be made are the 15 mm holes for the sensors. A faustner drill bit makes this very easy but if you do not have one on hand you can also drill many smaller holes on the circumference and knock the inside of the holes out. This works but the hole looks pretty rough after this process, so we highly recommend you use the proper drill. On the brige and on the base board you can countersink the two 7 mm holes so the screws that will go through these holes sit flush with the board surfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![](gfx/06_board_dims.JPG)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the wooden pieces are all drilles they are ready for the assembly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating the turntable\n",
    "The main part of the turntable is made of a ready made part which can be found in most kitchen ware stores. For our version we used the Ikea version of the spinning Susan (Snudda), but you can make it work with other models too.\n",
    "\n",
    "### (Optional) Disassemble the Snudda from Ikea \n",
    "If the Snudda does not move properly, the tabletop and the base of the Snudda need some modifications and it needs to be disassembled. This can be done by unscrewing the bolt at the bottom of the Snudda. This is easiest with a 13 mm nut since a normal wrench would not fit. Loosening the bolt makes it possible to take the base off of the turntable. The last step is to take off the bearing of the turntable which can be done by removing the three screws that fix it to the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Center finding\n",
    "\n",
    "To help with further steps down the line now would be a good point to mark the center of rotation for both the base and the turntable of the spinning Susan. For the turntable this can be done with the help of the three screwholes left by the bearing mount. You can draw a straight line from each hole to the next, mark each midpoint and connect the opposing hole with the midpoint. After doing this with all three sides the perpendicular lines all should cross in one point. This point is the center of the turn table\n",
    "\n",
    "For the base it is enough to mark the outline of the base of the snudda on the base board. Since both parts have holes in the center you can easily align them with the help of a drillbit to indicate the centeraxis. Once they are aligned draw the circular contour of the snudda base on the base board. This line can later help to make sure all parts are aligned within tolerance so all sensors will work well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preparing the tabletop\n",
    "\n",
    "After the centerfinding is done its time to work on the turntable top. The first thing to do is to drill a straight hole in the center. This whole will be home to the driveshaft of the OBI Orbita and if it is too much out of alignment the motor won't be able to turn the Snudda, so best try to make the hole as straight as possible. Ideally the hole is 5,5 mm so the Shaft has an Interference fitting but a 6 mm hole would also work. The Hole needs countersinking on both sides so the hot glue that will hold the shaft in place has room and enough surface area to hold onto.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the center hole is established lay out some more or less parallel strips of double sided tape on the top of table. Remove the upper protection of the tape and lay down the two cork matts perpendicular to the tape lines. Press the cork matts well against the base and cut off the exess of the cork matts with a sharp cutter. You can use the side of the Snudda to help you as a guide for the cutter. Also cut out the center hole out of the cork. Now you can make two perpendiculat Lines through the center on the cork matts. On each line mark 50 mm, 100 mm and 150 mm from the center. These marks will help you align the steel rings correctly in the next steps. If you use other ring diameters you need to adjust your marks accordingly.\n",
    "After these marks are layed out the three steel rings are placed onto their respective marks. Once they are well aligned trace the inside and outside of each ring onto the cork. Remove the rings and start following the previously made traced of the rings with a cutter. Once everything is cut remove the parts of cork that were under the rings previously. Now each ring has its own groove in the tabletop surface of the snudde. Lay down the rings in theirs grooves. You can add some hot glue under the rings to make sure they stay in place.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install the driveshaft\n",
    "\n",
    "![](gfx/07_snudda_shaft.JPG)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that the the table top is finished so far its time to install the driveshaft that will turn the turntable later. For this take the 6 mm pin which should have chamfers on each end and put it in the centerhole. Idealy there is a tight fit between the shaft and the turntable. If you need some extra force to drive the pin further you can use a small hammer carefully until the pin sits flush with the underside of the turntable. Now you can fill up the chamfers around the centerhole and shaft with hot glue. On the bottom of the turntable cut off any excess hot glue with a cutter blade.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building the sensor bridge\n",
    "\n",
    "After the table top is finished its time to work on the sensor bridge that will sit above the turntable and carries the sensors. Since all necessary holes have already been made this will be fairly simple. Place one sensor in one of the three bigger 15 mm holes of your choosing. Turn the sensor so the two cable connectors are facing along the long side of the bridge. The sensors have two little holes in them. Fix the sensor with two 8 x 1 mm screws. Repeat the same process for the other two sensors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assembly of base, turntable and sensorbridge\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point all major asemblies are ready. The Snudda bearing can be screwd back on to the turntable together with the coaxial bolt which got disasambled earlier. The snudda base gets screwd with the nut back together. Now the Snudda can be aligned onto the baseplate with the help of the trace of the base from earlier. You can clamp the Snudda to the baseplate or hold it tight while the snudda base get screwed togther with the baseplate with som woodscrews. Two of the M6 bolts can be place into the remaining holes and screwd on top togther with the 40 mm sleeves. Now the sensor brige can also be equipped with the rest of the M6 bolts and conncted with the sleeves. The sensors need to face down onto the tabletop.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Connecting the motor\n",
    "\n",
    "For the motor we need a motorstand that will hold the motor shaft axially aligned to the driveshaft of the turntable. The motor can get fixed to the motorstand with a zip tie. Connect the shaft coupling to the drive shaft and slide the motor shaft down into the other side of the coupling and tighten the set screws. A quick test run with the motorstand clamped to the bridge is recommended to confirm everything works fine. If that test run is succesful the stand can get screwed to the bridge.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Connecting the sensors and the mainboard\n",
    "\n",
    "You can mount the main board on the side of the baseplate, close to the three sensors. An easy mounting option is to use 15 mm long M4 sleeves and wood screws into the baseplate. Hence, all connectors are easily accessible and the board is mounted securely. The sensors get daisy chained together so that the outer most sensor input cable comes fromt the mainboard. After that you can connect the motor cable from the mainboard to the motor. The motor cable can be connected to the motor only losely by inserting unsleeved ends into the two motor connectors or if everything works well this connection can also be soldered. \n",
    "After this step the OBI Orbita is finished and everything thats left to do is to connect it to your computer and start experimenting.\n",
