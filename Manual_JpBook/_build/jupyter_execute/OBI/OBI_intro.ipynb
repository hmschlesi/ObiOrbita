    "# OBI Orbita\n",
    "\n",
    "Obi Orbita is a circular MIDI Sequenzer that brings can turn color and movement into rythmens. It is based on the original [Orbita](https://orbita.playtronica.com/) by Playtronica and uses the same electronic componets and color buttons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project, \"Orbits on a Budget\" (also known as OBI Orbitar), aims to create a manual and design for the Orbitar that can be built with a minimal budget and conventional tools. We plan to incorporate services like Zuschnittservice at Baumarkt and recycled wood into our design process. This concept prioritizes cost-efficiency over convenience or advanced functions, providing ample opportunities for quality improvement or specific function focus during the construction process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Idea to extend the Orbita by an OpenSource Verison is trying to extend the impact of the product and also offering a low-cost and low-tech alternative. The OBI orbita should be easy to rebuild with common handtools and an afternoon of time. You can find the bill of materials for this project [here](https://github.com/hmschlesi/ObiOrbita/blob/main/Hardware/BOM_OBIOrbitarct.xlsx) together with some options where you could source the parts.\n",
